## Paper Submission and Templates

We accept long papers (describing substantial original research) of up to eight (8) pages and short papers (making a small, focused contribution) of up to four (4) pages. If a paper is accepted, the authors will be given an additional page to address reviewers' comments in the final version. The ethics statement (optional), limitations (optional), references, and appendices do not count against these limits. Papers should adhere to the following guidelines:
- [Instructions for Two-Way Anonymized Review](https://aclrollingreview.org/cfp#instructions-for-two-way-anonymized-review)
- [Authorship](https://aclrollingreview.org/cfp#authorship)
- [Citation and Comparison](https://aclrollingreview.org/cfp#citation-and-comparison)
- [Ethics Policy](https://aclrollingreview.org/cfp#ethics-policy) (although note that we do not require completion of the responsible NLP research checklist)

Paper submissions must use the official ACL style templates, which are available [here](https://github.com/acl-org/acl-style-files) (Latex and Word). Submissions that do not conform to the required styles, including paper size, margin width, and font size restrictions, will be rejected without review.

## Dual Submission Policy

Dual submissions are allowed. Authors of papers that have been or will be submitted to other meetings or publications must provide this information to the workshop co-chairs (dmr.workshop.2026@gmail.com). In your message, please list the names and dates of the conferences, workshops or meetings where you have submitted or plan to submit your paper in addition to DMR. Authors of accepted papers must notify the program chairs within 5 business days of acceptance if the paper is withdrawn for any reason.
